## 🎯 Business Question

> *"Instagram is testing an AI-curated 'For You' feed vs. a chronological feed across 50,000 users. Did it improve engagement — and should we ship it to everyone?"*

---

## 🔍 Key Finding

The AI feed drove a statistically significant **+12% lift** in daily active minutes — but segmentation revealed that **18–24 casual users showed elevated churn risk** in the treatment group. This changed the recommendation from a full launch to a **staged rollout**, saving an estimated millions in potential churn losses.

## 🗂️ Project Modules

### 1. 🧪 A/B Testing & Experimentation
- Power analysis to confirm experiment was sufficiently powered
- Randomization sanity checks (pre-experiment metric comparison)
- Two-sample t-test + chi-square on 5 metrics
- **Novelty effect check** — weekly lift analysis to confirm the effect is lasting
- **Multiple testing correction** — Bonferroni + Benjamini-Hochberg
- Segmentation by age group and account type

### 2. 🤖 Churn Prediction (ML)
- Feature engineering — engagement drop, recency score, user tenure
- Class imbalance handled with SMOTE
- **Logistic Regression baseline** vs **XGBoost** — justified model complexity
- **SHAP explainability** — feature importance for PM conversations
- **Calibration curve + Platt Scaling** — verified probability trustworthiness
- AUC-ROC: 0.84

### 3. 💬 NLP & GenAI
- Sentiment analysis using HuggingFace DistilBERT
- BERTopic topic modeling — discovered content clusters unsupervised
- **Word clouds** per topic cluster for visual presentation
- Topic distribution comparison: control vs. treatment feed
- Claude API integration — auto-generated weekly trend summary

### 4. 📊 Streamlit Dashboard (5 pages)
- Overview — key experiment metrics at a glance
- A/B Test Results — interactive segment explorer
- Churn Risk Monitor — model predictions + SHAP plots
- Content Intelligence — sentiment + topic analysis + AI trend summary
- **💰 Business Impact Estimator** — interactive revenue calculator with sensitivity analysis
- Final Product Recommendation

## 💡 Final Recommendation

| Segment | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 25–34 age group | ✅ Ship AI feed | Highest engagement lift, low churn risk |
| 35–44 age group | ✅ Ship AI feed | Stable lift, strong retention |
| 18–24 casual users | ⚠️ Hold | Elevated churn risk in treatment group |
| Business accounts | ✅ Ship AI feed | Positive lift, no guardrail violations |

**Estimated 90-day impact (if recommendation followed):**
- +8% DAU lift across eligible segments
- -3% overall churn rate reduction
- Significant estimated annual revenue impact
